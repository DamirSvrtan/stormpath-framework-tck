# Stormpath Framework TCK

The Stormpath Framework TCK (Test Compatibility Kit) is a collection of HTTP-based integration tests that ensure a
Stormpath web framework integration supports all
[Stormpath Framework Specification](https://github.com/stormpath/stormpath-framework-spec) behavior.  The TCK uses
only HTTP(S) requests to ensure that they may execute against a web application written in any
programming language that uses any of the various Stormpath [integrations](https://docs.stormpath.com/home/)

This project is mostly used by the Stormpath SDK teams to ensure stability and consistent behavior for
our customers, especially those that use Stormpath across multiple programming languages. And for our own
development sanity :)  Comments, suggestions and/or contributions from the Open Source community are most welcome.
